# TeGo-OS v2.8.0: Digital Employee · Enterprise Avatar

> Give every employee their own AI avatar, working 24/7 to assist them.

---

## A Milestone Release

TeGo-OS v2.8.0 is a **landmark release**. We are officially launching the **Digital Avatar** system — a complete enterprise-grade AI digital employee platform that gives every member of an organization their own dedicated AI avatar.

Traditional AI assistants follow a "one tool, shared by all" model. TeGo-OS v2.8.0 fundamentally changes this — **every digital avatar is an independent AI agent runtime** with its own compute resources, data storage, skill configuration, conversation memory, and security boundary.

**In one sentence: Not just giving employees an AI assistant, but equipping every employee with a full-time digital avatar.**

## Six Core Capabilities

### 1. Personal Avatars

Every employee creates their own AI digital avatar, running independently with private data isolation.

- Sales manager's avatar: Install "CRM Query" + "Quote Generation" + "Customer Profiling" skills
- Developer's avatar: Install "Code Review" + "Database Query" + "Doc Generation" skills
- Finance staff's avatar: Install "Financial Reports" + "Tax Calculation" + "Compliance Check" skills

### 2. Organizational Avatars

Admins create shared avatars for departments/teams, accessible by all tenant members. Supports multi-replica high availability, 100 users per replica.

### 3. Independent Container Runtime

Each avatar runs in its own Docker container with fully isolated resources:
- CPU: 0.25 – 4.0 cores configurable
- Memory: 512MB – 8GB configurable
- Storage: Persistent data independently mounted

### 4. Multi-Tenant 4-Layer Isolation

- **Database layer**: All tables auto-isolated by tenant
- **Cache layer**: Cache keys isolated by tenant
- **File layer**: Skill packs and documents stored independently per tenant
- **Container layer**: Each avatar runs in its own container

### 5. Full Lifecycle Management

Create → Approve → Auto-deploy → Run → Stop → Uninstall — complete state machine management. Failed deployments auto-rollback, container anomalies auto-restart, 30-second heartbeat monitoring.

### 6. Hot-Pluggable Skills

Avatars gain capabilities by installing Agent Skills, as simple as installing phone apps. Compatible with Claude Agent Skills open standard, supporting runtime hot-plug without restart.
