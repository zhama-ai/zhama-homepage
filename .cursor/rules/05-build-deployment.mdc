## Build
- [vite.config.ts](mdc:vite.config.ts) - Vite configuration for building the project
- Run `npm run build` to create a production build in the `dist` directory
- Run `npm run preview` to preview the production build locally

## Docker Deployment
- [Dockerfile](mdc:Dockerfile) - Configuration for containerizing the application
- [docker/](mdc:docker/) - Additional Docker configurations
- [tag.sh](mdc:tag.sh) - Script for tagging Docker images

## CI/CD
